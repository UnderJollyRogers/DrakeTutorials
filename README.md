# DrakeTutorials

In this repository, I will be exploring the Drake tutorials and solving the homework assignments from the MIT course on Robotic Manipulation and Underactuated Robots available on YouTube.

## Setup Instructions

Before running the Python files, you need to set up a virtual environment with the content of the robotic manipulation class. To do so, run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
python3.10 -m venv vdrake
source vdrake/bin/activate
pip3 install manipulation --extra-index-url https://drake-packages.csail.mit.edu/whl/nightly/
exit
For more details on the installation, follow this link: [Installation Guide](https://manipulation.csail.mit.edu/drake.html).
